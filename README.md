# Data/File integrity tool 🛡️

## Overview 📄
- Secure Hashing is an Enhanced Python-based file/data integrity verification tool tool that implements various SHA hashing algorithms to validate file integrity and detect potentially malicious files. This project aims to enhance security through file validation techniques.

## Features ✨
- Multiple SHA Algorithms: Supports SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 for diverse hashing options.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling for file access and processing exceptions.
- Hash Comparison: Compares files against known hashes to detect modifications.
- User-Friendly Interface: Command-line interface for easy interaction and file scanning.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- Python
- several Python libraries
- hashlib
- Git
- GitHub
